Stabledog: I have a midi keyboard with an odd malfunction: it is sending CC11 messages every 10ms for no good reason.  I assume that some sensor has failed and is now reading noise.  Other than that, the keyboard works fine but it's flooding Ableton Live with these nonsense messages.

I found this open source program called "SendMIDI" online, its now our vscode Workspace.  Its  README.md describes the CLI for using the program, which I believe is able to filter out the bad messages -- so the idea would be to run this, having it read from the input midi and write to a virtual output midi, deleting the bad data and passing everything else.

What do you think, given the description in README.md?

Workspace: 

Stabledog: I do not understand that error message

GitHub Copilot: Based on the README.md, `SendMIDI` is primarily designed to send MIDI messages rather than filter them. However, you can use another tool called `mididings` to filter out the unwanted CC11 messages. Here's how you can set it up:

1. Install `mididings`:
   ```sh
   pip install mididings
   ```

2. Create a script to filter out CC11 messages:
   ```python
   from mididings import *

   config(
       backend='alsa',  # Use 'coremidi' for macOS
       client_name='MIDI Filter',
       in_ports=['Input'],
       out_ports=['Output']
   )

   run(
       Filter(~CtrlFilter(11)) >> Output('Output')
   )
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python your_script_name.py
   ```

This script will filter out all CC11 messages and pass everything else through.

Stabledog: I'm on Windows, not mac

GitHub Copilot: Since `SendMIDI` is primarily for sending MIDI messages and not filtering them, you might want to use another tool like `MIDI-OX` on Windows to filter out the unwanted CC11 messages.

Here’s how you can set it up:

1. Download and install `MIDI-OX` from [here](http://www.midiox.com/).

2. Open `MIDI-OX`.

3. Go to `Options` > `MIDI Filter`.

4. In the `MIDI Filter` dialog, check `Filter out data` and then check `Control Change` under `Filter out data`.

5. Click on `Control Change` to specify which control change messages to filter. In the new dialog, check `11` (which corresponds to CC11) and click `OK`.

6. Set up your MIDI input and output devices in `MIDI-OX` to route the filtered MIDI data to your desired output.

This will filter out the CC11 messages while allowing other MIDI messages to pass through.

Stabledog: Midi-OX is 14 years old and no longer supported

GitHub Copilot: Given that `SendMIDI` is not designed for filtering MIDI messages, you can use another tool called `Bome MIDI Translator Pro` on Windows to filter out the unwanted CC11 messages. Here’s how you can set it up:

1. Download and install `Bome MIDI Translator Pro` from [here](https://www.bome.com/products/miditranslator).

2. Open `Bome MIDI Translator Pro`.

3. Create a new project and add a new translator.

4. Set the incoming message to match the CC11 messages:
   - Click on `Incoming` and select `MIDI Message`.
   - Choose `Control Change` and set the controller number to `11`.

5. Set the outgoing message to `None` to filter out the CC11 messages:
   - Click on `Outgoing` and select `None`.

6. Set up your MIDI input and output devices in `Bome MIDI Translator Pro` to route the filtered MIDI data to your desired output.

This will filter out the CC11 messages while allowing other MIDI messages to pass through.

Stabledog: I think you're misunderstanding.  SendMIDI is primarily for sending, but it can also read.  So if it can both read and write, it should be possible to hook up a solution

GitHub Copilot: To filter out the unwanted CC11 messages using `SendMIDI`, you can use a combination of `SendMIDI` and a virtual MIDI port. Here’s how you can set it up on Windows:

1. **Install a virtual MIDI port**:
   - Download and install `loopMIDI` from [here](https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html).
   - Create a new virtual MIDI port named `loopMIDI Port`.

2. **Set up `SendMIDI` to filter out CC11 messages**:
   - Create a script to read from your MIDI input device, filter out CC11 messages, and send the rest to the virtual MIDI port.

Here is a sample Python script using `mido` to filter out CC11 messages:

```python
import mido

input_port_name = 'Your MIDI Input Device Name'
output_port_name = 'loopMIDI Port'

with mido.open_input(input_port_name) as inport, mido.open_output(output_port_name) as outport:
    for msg in inport:
        if not (msg.type == 'control_change' and msg.control == 11):
            outport.send(msg)
```

3. **Run the script**:
   - Save the script as `filter_midi.py`.
   - Run the script using Python:
     ```sh
     python filter_midi.py
     ```

4. **Configure your DAW (Ableton Live)**:
   - Set the input of your DAW to the virtual MIDI port (`loopMIDI Port`).

This setup will filter out the CC11 messages and pass all other MIDI messages to the virtual MIDI port, which can then be used as the input in your DAW.

Stabledog: In reading your proposed solution, I don't see a need for SendMIDI at all -- it seems like the mido library and loopMIDI are the only active components besides the python script

GitHub Copilot: You are correct. If the goal is to filter out the unwanted CC11 messages, the `mido` library and `loopMIDI` are sufficient. `SendMIDI` is not necessary for this task. Here is the complete solution using `mido` and `loopMIDI`:

1. **Install `mido` and `python-rtmidi`**:
   ```sh
   pip install mido python-rtmidi
   ```

2. **Create a Python script to filter out CC11 messages**:
   ```python
   import mido

   input_port_name = 'Your MIDI Input Device Name'
   output_port_name = 'loopMIDI Port'

   with mido.open_input(input_port_name) as inport, mido.open_output(output_port_name) as outport:
       for msg in inport:
           if not (msg.type == 'control_change' and msg.control == 11):
               outport.send(msg)
   ```

3. **Run the script**:
   - Save the script as `filter_midi.py`.
   - Run the script using Python:
     ```sh
     python filter_midi.py
     ```

4. **Configure your DAW (Ableton Live)**:
   - Set the input of your DAW to the virtual MIDI port (`loopMIDI Port`).

This setup will filter out the CC11 messages and pass all other MIDI messages to the virtual MIDI port, which can then be used as the input in your DAW.

Stabledog: Looking at the proposed script, I don't see the role of python-rtmidi.  Why does it need to be installed?

GitHub Copilot: You are correct. The `python-rtmidi` library is not necessary for this script. The `mido` library can handle the MIDI input and output on its own. Here is the revised solution without `python-rtmidi`:

1. **Install `mido`**:
   ```sh
   pip install mido
   ```

2. **Create a Python script to filter out CC11 messages**:
   ```python
   import mido

   input_port_name = 'Your MIDI Input Device Name'
   output_port_name = 'loopMIDI Port'

   with mido.open_input(input_port_name) as inport, mido.open_output(output_port_name) as outport:
       for msg in inport:
           if not (msg.type == 'control_change' and msg.control == 11):
               outport.send(msg)
   ```

3. **Run the script**:
   - Save the script as `filter_midi.py`.
   - Run the script using Python:
     ```sh
     python filter_midi.py
     ```

4. **Configure your DAW (Ableton Live)**:
   - Set the input of your DAW to the virtual MIDI port (`loopMIDI Port`).

This setup will filter out the CC11 messages and pass all other MIDI messages to the virtual MIDI port, which can then be used as the input in your DAW.

Stabledog: I have added the mido source tree as a submodule in ./mido -- using the README.rst in that tree, and the docs folder, revisit your script proposal -- is it valid?  What are the weak points?

GitHub Copilot: Let's revisit the script proposal using the `mido` source tree as a submodule. First, ensure that the `mido` submodule is initialized and updated:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Now, let's review the script using the `mido` library from the submodule:

1. **Update the script to use the local `mido` submodule**:
   ```python
   import sys
   sys.path.insert(0, './mido')

   import mido

   input_port_name = 'Your MIDI Input Device Name'
   output_port_name = 'loopMIDI Port'

   with mido.open_input(input_port_name) as inport, mido.open_output(output_port_name) as outport:
       for msg in inport:
           if not (msg.type == 'control_change' and msg.control == 11):
               outport.send(msg)
   ```

2. **Run the script**:
   - Save the script as `filter_midi.py`.
   - Run the script using Python:
     ```sh
     python filter_midi.py
     ```

### Validity and Weak Points

**Validity**:
- The script should work as intended, filtering out CC11 messages and passing all other MIDI messages to the virtual MIDI port.

**Weak Points**:
1. **Error Handling**:
   - The script lacks error handling. If the MIDI input or output ports are not found, it will raise an exception. Adding error handling would make it more robust.

2. **Port Names**:
   - The script requires the exact names of the MIDI input and output ports. If the names are incorrect or change, the script will fail. Adding a mechanism to list available ports and select the correct ones would improve usability.

3. **Performance**:
   - The script processes messages in a blocking manner. If the input rate is very high, it might not keep up. Using non-blocking I/O or threading could improve performance.

4. **Resource Management**:
   - The script opens the input and output ports but does not explicitly close them. Using a context manager ensures they are properly closed, but additional cleanup might be necessary in case of errors.

### Improved Script with Error Handling and Port Listing

Here is an improved version of the script addressing some of the weak points:

```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, './mido')

import mido

def list_ports():
    print("Available input ports:")
    for name in mido.get_input_names():
        print(f"  {name}")
    print("\nAvailable output ports:")
    for name in mido.get_output_names():
        print(f"  {name}")

def main():
    input_port_name = 'Your MIDI Input Device Name'
    output_port_name = 'loopMIDI Port'

    try:
        with mido.open_input(input_port_name) as inport, mido.open_output(output_port_name) as outport:
            for msg in inport:
                if not (msg.type == 'control_change' and msg.control == 11):
                    outport.send(msg)
    except (IOError, OSError) as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        list_ports()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This script includes a function to list available MIDI ports and basic error handling to improve robustness.

Stabledog: Also, the fact that I brought in the source code for mido does not mean that I want to actually import it at runtime -- I just did it to get the documentation.  I would still prefer to import the pip package that's been (presumably) tested and published

GitHub Copilot: Understood. Let's revise the script to use the `mido` package installed via `pip` and ensure it is robust and user-friendly.

1. **Install `mido`**:
   ```sh
   pip install mido
   ```

2. **Create a Python script to filter out CC11 messages**:
   ```python
   import mido

   def list_ports():
       print("Available input ports:")
       for name in mido.get_input_names():
           print(f"  {name}")
       print("\nAvailable output ports:")
       for name in mido.get_output_names():
           print(f"  {name}")

   def main():
       input_port_name = 'Your MIDI Input Device Name'
       output_port_name = 'loopMIDI Port'

       try:
           with mido.open_input(input_port_name) as inport, mido.open_output(output_port_name) as outport:
               for msg in inport:
                   if not (msg.type == 'control_change' and msg.control == 11):
                       outport.send(msg)
       except (IOError, OSError) as e:
           print(f"Error: {e}")
           list_ports()

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       main()
   ```

3. **Run the script**:
   - Save the script as `filter_midi.py`.
   - Run the script using Python:
     ```sh
     python filter_midi.py
     ```

### Explanation

- **Error Handling**: The script includes basic error handling to catch and display errors related to opening MIDI ports.
- **Port Listing**: If an error occurs, the script lists available MIDI input and output ports to help the user identify the correct port names.
- **Filtering Logic**: The script filters out CC11 messages and passes all other MIDI messages to the virtual MIDI port.

This setup ensures that you are using the tested and published `mido` package from `pip`, while also providing a robust and user-friendly solution for filtering MIDI messages.

Stabledog: I would like to rework the solution so that the business logic of the code becomes a python package, and the main module handles command line options and top level flow only.  I don't know the current best-practices for restructuring the tree though

GitHub Copilot: To restructure the code into a Python package and separate the business logic from the command-line interface, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a package structure**:
   ```
   midi_filter/
   ├── midi_filter/
   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   ├── filter.py
   ├── filter_cc11.py
   ├── setup.py
   ├── README.md
   └── requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Move the business logic to the package**:
   - Create `midi_filter/filter.py`:
     ```python
     import mido

     def list_ports():
         print("Available input ports:")
         for name in mido.get_input_names():
             print(f"  {name}")
         print("\nAvailable output ports:")
         for name in mido.get_output_names():
             print(f"  {name}")

     def filter_midi(input_port_name, output_port_name):
         try:
             with mido.open_input(input_port_name) as inport, mido.open_output(output_port_name) as outport:
                 for msg in inport:
                     if not (msg.type == 'control_change' and msg.control == 11):
                         outport.send(msg)
         except (IOError, OSError) as e:
             print(f"Error: {e}")
             list_ports()
     ```

3. **Update the main script to use the package**:
   - Update 

filter_cc11.py

:
     ```python
     import argparse
     from midi_filter.filter import list_ports, filter_midi

     def main():
         parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Filter out CC11 messages from MIDI input.')
         parser.add_argument('input_port', help='Name of the MIDI input port')
         parser.add_argument('output_port', help='Name of the MIDI output port')
         args = parser.parse_args()

         filter_midi(args.input_port, args.output_port)

     if __name__ == '__main__':
         main()
     ```

4. **Create a `setup.py` for the package**:
   - Create `setup.py`:
     ```python
     from setuptools import setup, find_packages

     setup(
         name='midi_filter',
         version='0.1',
         packages=find_packages(),
         install_requires=[
             'mido',
         ],
         entry_points={
             'console_scripts': [
                 'filter-cc11=filter_cc11:main',
             ],
         },
     )
     ```

5. **Create a `requirements.txt`**:
   - Create `requirements.txt`:
     ```
     mido
     ```

6. **Create a `README.md`**:
   - Create `README.md`:
     ```markdown
     # MIDI Filter

     This package filters out CC11 messages from MIDI input.

     ## Installation

     ```sh
     pip install .
     ```

     ## Usage

     ```sh
     filter-cc11 <input_port> <output_port>
     ```
     ```

### Explanation

- **Package Structure**: The business logic is moved to `midi_filter/filter.py`, and the main script `filter_cc11.py` handles command-line options and top-level flow.
- **Command-Line Interface**: The `argparse` module is used to handle command-line arguments.
- **Setup Script**: The `setup.py` script defines the package and its dependencies, and creates a console script entry point for easy execution.
- **Documentation**: The `README.md` provides installation and usage instructions.

This structure follows best practices for Python packages, making the code modular, reusable, and easy to maintain.### Explanation

Stabledog: my project is named cc11-fix, I don't want to imply that this is a general purpose midi filter in the naming

GitHub Copilot: Let's restructure the project with the name `cc11-fix` and ensure the naming reflects its specific purpose. Here is the updated structure and code:

1. **Project Structure**:

         print("\nAvailable output ports:")
         for name in mido.get_output_names():
             print(f"  {name}")

     def filter_midi(input_port_name, output_port_name):
         try:
             with mido.open_input(input_port_name) as inport, mido.open_output(output_port_name) as outport:
                 for msg in inport:
                     if not (msg.type == 'control_change' and msg.control == 11):
                         outport.send(msg)
         except (IOError, OSError) as e:

             ],
         },
     )
     ```
